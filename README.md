>This nifty Bash script is your personal Downloads folder superhero! 🦸‍♂️ It swoops into your Downloads (or any other directory you point it to) and tidies up the chaos by sorting your files into neat little folders. Whether it's images, documents, videos, music, archives, programs, or those random files that don't fit anywhere else—this script has got them covered! Just run it, and watch as your files magically get organized into an "Organized" folder. Say goodbye to clutter and hello to a cleaner, more organized life! 🚀✨
